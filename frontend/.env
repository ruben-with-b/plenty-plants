# In production both, the frontend and the backend, are deployed on the same
# machine. Due to this fact the environment variables defined in the frontend
# and in the backend have to be unique!

# For development we deploy each, the backend as well as the frontend, on a
# dedicated development-server. The frontend is deployed on port PORT.
